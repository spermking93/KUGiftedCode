## 1st Week

### Constructing Environments   

  We will set up the computers especially OS and terminal.
We are going to use WSL and CMD because almost of the students definetaly will use Window machine.  
So we will teach how to set up the computer environment and install the python3. 

### Basic Python

  We supposed that all students are the novice for the python grammer. So we will teach basic python method and some applications for that.

## 2nd Week

### rasepberry pi4
  We will teach how to setup rasepberry pi4 from A to Z. Aldo We will let them know the concept of host(server) and client. If they pass this week successgly, they can connect to rasepberry pi4 remotely via ssh command.

### IDE
 There are numorouse IDE curretly. We choose Vscode because it's free and easy to use for novice coder. We will also teach how to connect rasepberry pi4 with vscode.

### IO
The students will genrate the random data and save that in CSV format. They will learn IO process with csv and pandas dataframe.

[3rd Week Codes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGrldhiUSy23qNLiLCCRUnOv7TwUgPiX/view?usp=sharing)
=======

  Students can learn how to control the mini fan, water pump, led, and servo motor with GPIO network connection in this week. they will not gonna take data. Mentors can check their progress by uploaded code and movie from students.

### Learning sensors module by module

  Students will learn howto control the sensors one by one. 
  They will have an asignment to complete the wiring.  

## 4th Week

Now students can take the datas. they can draw 2D, 3D graph with thier own datas. They will see the instant  data with light(lux) , temperature, humidity, and gyro(tilt) sensors. Also they can visualize the data with matplotlib package. They have to upload their own code , not screenshot result. 

### light sensor
  Students will draw graph - time vs quantity of the light(lux). Mentors will check the 

### temperature and humidity sensor
  Students will learn how to get the temperature and humidity sensors

### gyro sensor
  Students can print the x,y,z acceleration with gyro(tilt) sensor.

### light sensor graph
  Students will be given assignment that drawing the graph of the quantity of light vs time.

### temperature and humidity graph
  Students will draw the graph.

### gyro sensor graph
  Students will draw the graph. - It doesn't matter 3D or 2D graph. But they should extract the 1 row data with their own data.
   
### Final Assignment
  Final goal of 4th week is uploading the code for drawing 2D or 3D graph for what they choose.

## 5th Week

 Students will learn about 'if' command. Specifically, they will make thier own code to turn on water pump 'if' the humidity is lower than certain threshold.
They should take the sensors and module for making their own module - 'if'.

## 6th Week
  Stdudents will learn about the basic concept of machine learning - linear regression.
  They will take 10 points under certain time interval and predict the next data.
  The water pump and mini fan will turn on depending on the prediction data. 
  eg. if prediction is higher than 30 degree - It will be set up manually by user - mini fan will turn on.
  

# 7th Week - 8th Week

Finally they will make smart eco system with ML algorithm and sensors. The basic code will be given, but Final goal will be making their eco system.
